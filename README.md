# Ghost-Game

Ghost is a simple word game where players take turns adding letters to a growing word fragment, trying not to be the one to complete a valid word. 
You don't need anything special to play, just a friend and a mutual excess of time to burn. The rules are pretty simple: just don't complete a word, 
and every fragment must be the beginning of an actual word. Of course, you can still bluff your way through a round, which is where challenges come in. 
On your turn, you can challenge the previous player to name their word, afterwhich you win if they can't name a valid word, and vice versa. 

As we can see, the goal of player 1 is to make sure the final word is of 
even length, while player 2 wants it to be odd length. While in real life we 
vary the starting letters upon each run of the game, there are only two starting
letters in which player 1 can force a victory. In the rest of them, player 2 wins
with optimal play. 
Try playing with the solver to figure out the two letters!
